# Webshot
Screenshot websites as a service.

The images are getting cached for 1 minute and only the first load takes some time to process.

## Use cases
- You could use this as a preview image for your website in `og:image` or `twitter:image`
- Grab a screenshot of a bug in production, send the link instead of an image
- Always have up to date screenshots in your portfolio
